      </span>, and a creative at heart.

    <p class="mb-6">
      I started software development back in high school in 2019. It began as a
      hobby, sparked by my love for sci-fi movies and an obsession with the cool
      tech they featured — think robots, Arduinos, and those iconic streams of
      ones and zeros from <em>The Matrix</em>. I remember being fascinated by
      how software seemed to power everything — from video games and social
      media, to the apps we use every day.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      While the world around me suggested a more traditional path (doctor,
      lawyer... you know how it goes 😅), I chose code — and I haven’t looked
      back.

    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">What I’m doing now</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I’m currently a <strong>Software Engineering Intern at Mukuru</strong>,
      where I’m getting hands-on experience in building real-world applications
      and learning from some brilliant engineers. Every day’s a step forward —
      whether I’m writing cleaner code, shipping features, or just debugging
      something stubborn.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Beyond the 9-to-5, I’m constantly building side projects, writing about
      what I’m learning, and trying to refine my skills across both frontend and
      backend.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Outside of code...</h2>
    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        🎸 Playing guitar — I love fingerstyle and R&B-inspired progressions
      </li>
      <li>🎮 Gaming — always down for a good challenge</li>
      <li>🎥 Watching a sci-fi film (still can’t get enough)</li>
      <li>⚽ Playing or watching football</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="my-8 border-t-2 border-black" />

    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">What drives me</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I believe in building things that are both useful and meaningful — tools,
      stories, or ideas that make people feel something. My dream is to keep
      growing as a developer and maybe even help others along the way.
      Creativity, curiosity, and consistency — that’s my stack.
