      A little about me...
    </h1>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Hey, I’m Lilitha — a curious mind, a self-taught coder but also WTC-made, and a creative at heart.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      I started software development back in high school in 2019. It began as a hobby, sparked by my love for sci-fi movies and an obsession with the cool tech they featured — think robots, Arduinos, and those iconic streams of ones and zeros from <em>The Matrix</em>. I remember being fascinated by how software seemed to power everything — from video games and social media, to the apps we use every day.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      While the world around me suggested a more traditional path (doctor, lawyer... you know how it goes 😅), I chose code — and I haven’t looked back.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What I’m doing now</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I’m currently a <strong>Software Engineering Intern at Mukuru</strong>, where I’m getting hands-on experience in building real-world applications and learning from some brilliant engineers. Every day’s a step forward — whether I’m writing cleaner code, shipping features, or just debugging something stubborn.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Beyond the 9-to-5, I’m constantly building side projects, writing about what I’m learning, and trying to refine my skills across both frontend and backend.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Outside of code...</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>🎸 Playing guitar — I love fingerstyle and R&B-inspired progressions</li>
      <li>🎮 Gaming — always down for a good challenge</li>
      <li>🎥 Watching a sci-fi film (still can’t get enough)</li>
      <li>⚽ Playing or watching football</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="my-8 border-black border-t-2" />

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What drives me</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I believe in building things that are both useful and meaningful — tools, stories, or ideas that make people feel something. My dream is to keep growing as a developer and maybe even help others along the way. Creativity, curiosity, and consistency — that’s my stack.
    </p>

      If you're into building cool things, learning in public, or just vibing over sci-fi and sound design — hit me up ✌️
